# SolZipper
## Description
SolZipperCsharp is C# implementation of SolZipper. Inspired Rake's [SolZipper](https://github.com/guided-hacking/SolZipper)
## Why i write an implementation?
- I want add more features.  
- I think using powershell for zip operation is not a good idea.  
- For fun.
## TODO
- [ ] Add ".ignore" file feature for prevent delete some files by SolZipper (like ".gitignore")
- [ ] More cleanup on code
- [ ] Extend context menu feature for ".sln" file  (Opens context menu when right click to ".sln" file)
- [ ] Encryption feature
